                    First time I laid my eyes on someone like you
                    I can’t forget the hour, that moment with you
                    Then I have realized
                    Love is growing deep inside
                    I feel the beating of my heart

                    ‘Cause every day, every night, I keep looking at the skies
                    And I pray that someday
                    You will wake up in my arms and  love will never end
                    We belong together
                    Always and forever
                    Call my name and I’ll be there
                    
                    Spending my days and nights just thinking of you

                    When will I hear you say
                    Love is coming on your way
                    And that you start to feel the same
                    ‘Cause every day, every night, I keep looking at the skies
                    And I pray that someday
